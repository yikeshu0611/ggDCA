Description: Diagnostic and prognostic models are typically evaluated with 
    measures of accuracy that do not address clinical consequences. 
    Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but 
    often require collection of additional information and may be cumbersome to 
    apply to models that yield a continuous result.
  Decision curve analysis is a suitable method for evaluating 
    alternative diagnostic and prognostic strategies that has advantages over 
    other commonly used measures and techniques.
  This method was described by Andrew J. Vickers (2006) <doi:10.1177/0272989X06295361>.
